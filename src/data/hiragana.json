To type or write it in romaji, use \"r\" and write \"ra.\" The same goes for the rest of the R column. Use \"r\" when writing in romaji!\n\n`ら` looks like a `<u>ra</u>bbit` that's standing and facing left. Look at its big droopy ears. So cute!"

So this kana is just a plain old `<u>ro</u>ad`.\n\nAnd finally, the last group. This is a weird one. It includes わ (which is quite normal), を (which is pronounced just like お, but is primarily used as a particle), and ん (which is the only consonant-only character in all the kanaa). Let's go through them one by one."

You know ね is Nelly the cat because of the curl of the tail on the end. So you can imagine the cat chasing this wasp, which is why it's flying straight up to get away.
