A WaniKani study app with more learning strategies. Built foremost by Gemini! (most of the games were built directly by gemini with minimal human input).

Unfortunately, the illustrations provided by WK are not included here but you can find them on the official page.

The goal of this project is to give myself more ways of studying the kanji and keeping up with my studies.

The project contains various games and quizzes to help with memorization and recall.

It is still a work in progress but feel free to explore see if it works for you!

Many (currently all) illustrations provided by [Amanda Bear](https://community.wanikani.com/t/wk-mnemonic-art-for-kanji-levels-1-7-radical-levels-1-10/47656)!

# Note:

This is an open source project but please do not use it to bypass the WaniKani subscription model. WaniKani is an amazing service that deserves support from its users.
